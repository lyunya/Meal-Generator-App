# Meal Gen App
## What is this and why?
As someone who loves to cook, I sometimes struggle with coming up with ideas for what meals to make.
I thought what better way to remedy this problem than to create my own meal generator app. This app
uses the Spoonacular API and two different endpoints. It uses the "Generate Meal Plan" API to create a three meal plan based
on two parameters: # of calories and any diet restrictions. It then uses the Recipe ID returned with each meal to pull data from the "Get Recipe Information" endpoint. This provides the images and Recipe URLs allowing people to click through and find the recipe for each meal.
Now I can easily find new meals to cook!
